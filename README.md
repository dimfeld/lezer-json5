# Lezer grammar for JSON5

This grammar takes much of its content from the [official Lezer JavaScript grammar](https://github.com/lezer-parser/javascript)
and [Joakker's tree-sitter JSON5 grammar](https://github.com/Joakker/tree-sitter-json5). It can be used with
CodeMirror 6 to parse the [JSON5 syntax](https://json5.org/).
